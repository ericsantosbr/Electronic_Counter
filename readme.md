## A simple electronic counter with future integrations in mind

In Linux-based systems, it requires the python3-tk package to be installed in order to run. In apt, it should look like

```sudo apt install python3-tk```

After this, (venv is recommended), use

```python main.py```

to run it.

Enjoy! :D
